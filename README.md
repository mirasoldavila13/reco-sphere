- **Database**: MongoDB hosted on **MongoDB Atlas**, a managed cloud cluster, paired with **Mongoose** for schema modeling and query optimization.
  - Stores:
    - **User Data**: Credentials, preferences, and history.
    - **Content**: Metadata, genres, and ratings.
    - **Favorites**: User-managed collections of favorite content.
    - **Watchlist**: Content users plan to watch, optimized with compound indexing for user-specific data.
    - **Ratings**: User-submitted ratings for movies and TV shows, enhancing personalized recommendations.
    - **Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions generated by analyzing user behavior.
- **Microservices**: Spring Boot handles complex recommendation algorithms for tailored suggestions (currently in development).
- **Authentication**: Secured with JWT-based authentication, ensuring safe and seamless user sessions.
